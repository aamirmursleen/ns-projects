## Project summary

With PKT Cash, the opportunity for growth is there, but not everyone understands the mining aspect and the creation of PKT wallets, which are the backbone of PKT vision. 

I developed https://pktdesk.com for a broad understanding of the PKT project. It was essential to have a single place to answer all the questions people ask in the simplest of words.

I have written a total of 14 blog posts with screenshots and GIFs —more blog posts will be added over time.

The main objective of the blog is to increase people's understanding of mining and PKT technology that would help in the marketing of PKT.

In addition, mining required people to watch lengthy videos and follow complicated stuff. I made the PKT mining process’s guide extremely easy — with high-quality screenshots, GIFs, and simple script— even beginners can start mining without technical knowledge within 5 minutes.

As an example, instead of creating a wallet that requires users to enter dozens of command lines manually on Ubuntu, I recommend members to create a PKT mining wallet address using pkt.world’s Windows wallet and Zulu Wallet if they use Mac OS. Once they've created a PKT wallet address, they have to paste the first script that goes like this that update the server and install the essential without any input from the user:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt install curl -y && sudo apt install tmux -y && sudo apt install gcc git -y && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh && sudo apt install make && rm -rf packetcrypt_rs && pkill -f packetcrypt ; git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs && cd packetcrypt_rs && tmux
```
Once the user reaches the tmux session, he has to type the second script to start mining — I provided screenshots to help normal users understand.
```
~/.cargo/bin/cargo build --release ; ./target/release/packetcrypt ann -p pkt1qhalj5vn5eq5m0uelnswvtqwud9wc57srm9rqez http://pool.pkt.world http://pool.srizbi.com http://pool.pktpool.io 
```
By doing this, the mining time was reduced from 30 minutes to just 5 minutes. Consequently, the PKT project will grow faster because of the time saved — faster deployment leads to better scalability.

People are also concerned about finding mining servers from around the world. During my research, I found several hosting companies that allow mining on their servers so that people can earn PKTs and support the PKT infrastructure globally. 

The best part? With the right SEO strategy and on-page optimization, I ranked all the keywords to the top of Google as mentioned in the deliverables. 

PKT's vision will greatly benefit from the project in that it will enroll more people who will support the infrastructure of PKT.

## Who am I?

I'm Muhammad Aamir Mursleen, an SEO expert who has more than six years of experience. Additionally, I have contributed to well-known blogs such as SEMrush, Dawn, and WPReset. 

The thing that separates me from other writers is the ability to use screenshots and funny GIFs to illustrate my points with a lot of clarity. Writing simple, comprehensible language is what I do best.

Due to my ability to conduct robust, keyword research and build backlinks, I have grown the organic reach of different clients and projects by 100% in a few years. 

I currently work on topstudyworld.com, which receives over 600,000 hits per month. In addition to running the website, I'm an admin of Bloggers Funda that has over 150,000+ members. I have been teaching people in the group about SEO.

I'll continue to work on PKTDesk to grow it to the next level and write more articles as the need arises.
